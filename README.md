# Keyboard-Driver
Here is the driver code needed to operate
my home made keyboard on a Raspberry Pi 2
Code was written in C by Mark Paul
It includes a makefile which allows you
to compile using the make command
It can be executed using sudo ./keyboard

This project was done as a term project for my operating systems class COMP 3000.
The file includes a PDF document which was submitted for grading in December 2016

Special shout out to Phil Burgess from Adafruit Industries for writting an open scource
driver that maps GPIO pins to keyboard presses. Your retrogame.c code was my corner stone.
